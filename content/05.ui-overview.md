## User interface overview

This section gives an introduction to the CNApy UI and its components and functions.

When we have finished our first configuration we are greeted with a window like this.

**CNApy with an empty project.**

This is an empty project on the right hand side we see the empty lists of reactions and metabolites.
On the left we see the embedded Jupyter Console where one can interact programmatically with the model and UI.
We can create a new project by importing SBML models, editing the reactions and adding graphical maps.
We can also load one of the projects included in our projects repository.

Letâ€™s go to Project in our menubar and open the `ECC2comp.cna` project.

In this picture we see CNApy with the open ECC2comp project.
On the right hand side (1) we see the populated reactions and metabolites lists with the color coded current values and a form with corresponding details for the selected reaction/metabolite.
The reactions list contains buttons that lets us add/delete reactions to/from the model.
Changing the metabolite identifier or other details in the metabolite/reaction form has an instant effect on the corresponding reactions/metabolites in the model.


The console (2) now shows the output of some computations, and above the console we have a map view (3) with a graphical representation of our network.
On top (4) we have the menu bar which gives us access to the various functionalities of CNApy and a Toolbar for quick access to often used functions.

We can add new maps via the Map menu, and drag reactions from the reaction list onto the desired position on the map.
