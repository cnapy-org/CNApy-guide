## Configuration

When we start CNApy for the first time we are greeted with a dialog like this.

![
**CNApy Configuration dialog.**
](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cnapy-org/users-guide/main/content/images/config-dialog.png "Configuration dialog"){#fig:config-dialog}

With this dialog you can configure which Matlab/Octave installation CNApy should use.

The minimal cut set computation in CNApy uses functions that are provided by CellNetAnalyzer.
To be able to use these functions you have to provide CNApy with either a path to a Matlab installation >R2019 or the path to an Octave executable >4, and of course with a path to a recent CellNetAnalyzer installation.
You can do this by clicking these buttons (1).
If you change the settings CNApy performs some basic tests to make sure everything is working.
If all checks are successful green check marks  are shown, if a check fails a red cross  is shown.

If no check can be performed, a yellow question mark  is shown.
For example, the check of the CNA directory needs a working Matlab or Octave installation.

You can also configure which colors CNApy should use to highlight reactions on the map or in the reaction list.
