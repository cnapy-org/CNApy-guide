## Installation

### CNApy main program

There are three ways to install CNApy itself:

1. As the easiest way only under Windows, you can use the .exe installer attached to the assets at the bottom of [CNApy's latest release](https://github.com/cnapy-org/CNApy/releases/latest).
2. Under any operating system, you can install CNApy as a conda package as described in section [Install CNApy as conda package](https://github.com/cnapy-org/CNApy#install-cnapy-as-conda-package).
3. If you want to clone and/or develop CNApy, follow the instruction in section [Setup the CNApy development environment](https://github.com/cnapy-org/CNApy#setup-the-cnapy-development-environment).

**NOTE: After CNApy's installation, it is recommended to download the [CNApy example projects](https://github.com/cnapy-org/CNApy-projects) (including interactive maps of models such as [ECC2](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39647), [*i*ML1515](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3956) and many more) by starting CNApy and clicking on "Download CNApy example projects..." in the "Projects" menu entry.**


### Installing additional solvers (optional)

CNApy itself is already packaged and installed with the open source linear programming solver [GLPK](https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/) which is fast enough for calculations with small models and which is not restricted in the possible number of variables.

In addition, CNApy is also pre-packaged with the Community editions of the much more powerful commercial solvers [IBM CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio) and [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/). These community editions can only run with models up to 1000 variables. In order to use one of these solvers with models which contain more variables, the *full versions* of either two of these solvers have to be installed and connected to CNApy. In order to help you with this process, CNApy contains a wizard which explains the process in detail and which takes over some of the neccessary tasks. You can find the wizards under the "Config" menu entry.

For strain design and thermodyanmic calculations, you can also use the free and open-source solver [SCIP](https://www.scipopt.org/) which is much faster than GLPK but still often much slower than IBM CPLEX and Gurobi. You can install SCIP according to the instructions [on its website](https://www.scipopt.org/index.php#download).
