## Installation

### CNApy main program

There are two ways to install CNApy itself:

1. Recommended but more complicated: Under any operating system, by installing CNApy as a conda package. For detailed instructions to do this, see [https://github.com/cnapy-org/CNApy#install-cnapy-with-conda](https://github.com/cnapy-org/CNApy#install-cnapy-with-conda).
2. Not recommended but simple: Under Windows, you can install CNApy by using the .exe installer attached to [CNApy's latest release](https://github.com/cnapy-org/CNApy/releases/latest). Once you run the installer, it will guide you through the installation process. Please note that the installation process may take some time.


### Additional solvers (optional)

CNApy itself is already packaged and installed with the open source linear programming solver [GLPK](https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/) which is fast enough for calculations with small models and which is not restricted in the possible number of variables.

*Completely optional*: In addition, CNApy is also pre-packaged with the Community editions of the much more powerful commercial solvers [IBM CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio) and [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/). These community editions can only run with models up to 1000 variables. In order to use one of these solvers with models which contain more variables, the *full versions* of either two of these solvers have to be installed and connected to CNApy. In order to help you with this process, CNApy contains a wizard which explains the process in detail and which takes over some of the neccessary tasks. You can find the wizards under the "Config" menu entry.
