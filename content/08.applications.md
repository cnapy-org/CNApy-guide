## Analysing a metabolic model

### Flux balance analysis (FBA)

Optimizes the value of the current objective function and shows a flux distribution that realizes this optimum.
The objective function is a linear function over the reaction rates in the network, its coefficients can be modified in the reaction dialogs.
To display the current objective function in the console you can call “Show optimization function” from the analysis menu.
Note that the flux distribution calculated by FBA is usually not unique.

### Parsimonious FBA (pFBA)

In parsimonious FBA first the objective function optimized and then with this optimum as additional constraint the sum of the fluxes in the network is minimized.
This has the advantage that redundant internal cyclic fluxes are suppressed and that a lot of reactions will have zero flux which makes the solution easier to understand.

### Flux variability analysis (FVA)

In FVA the maximal/minimal rate of each reaction is calculated.
This gives the possible flux range for each reaction.

### Elementary modes (EFM)/elementary flux vectors (EFV)

EFM can be calculated via CNA or directly via efmtool while for EFV CNA is required.


#### Options for CNA and efmtool

When reactions are marked with 0 flux in a scenario and the option “consider 0 in current scenario as off” is activated then only the subset of EFM/EFV is calculated in which these reactions do not participate

#### Additional options for CNA

#### use flux bounds to calculate elementary flux vectors
To calculate EFV instead of EFM, activate this option. Flux bounds defined in the reactions and the current scenario are then taken into account as inhomogeneous constraints. A flux bound is only included when its absolute value is greater than the value given as “Threshold for bounds to be unconstrained”.

#### check reversibility

Unchecking this option will lead to all reactions being considered reversible even if they have a rate minimum ≥ 0.

##### only convex basis

Currently has no effect (need to be able to switch computation method first).

##### consider isozymes only once

If a group of reactions has the same stoichiometry then only the modes with one representative of that group are calculated.

##### use rational numbers

Use rational numbers of arbitrary length for EFM/EFV computation (efmtool part only, results will still appear as floating point numbers)
