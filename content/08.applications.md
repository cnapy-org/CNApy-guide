## Analysis functions

### Flux balance analysis (FBA)

Optimizes the value of the current objective function and shows a flux distribution that realizes this optimum.
The objective function is a linear function over the reaction rates in the network, its coefficients can be modified in the reaction dialogs.
To display the current objective function in the console you can call “Show optimization function” from the analysis menu.
Note that the flux distribution calculated by FBA is usually not unique.

### Parsimonious FBA (pFBA)

In parsimonious FBA first the objective function optimized and then with this optimum as additional constraint the sum of the fluxes in the network is minimized.
This has the advantage that redundant internal cyclic fluxes are suppressed and that a lot of reactions will have zero flux which makes the solution easier to understand.

### Flux variability analysis (FVA)

In FVA the maximal/minimal rate of each reaction is calculated.
This gives the possible flux range for each reaction.

### Elementary modes (EFM)/elementary flux vectors (EFV)

EFM can be calculated via CNA or directly via efmtool while for EFV CNA is required.

#### Options for CNA and efmtool

When reactions are marked with 0 flux in a scenario and the option “consider 0 in current scenario as off” is activated then only the subset of EFM/EFV is calculated in which these reactions do not participate

#### Additional options for CNA

- use flux bounds to calculate elementary flux vectors
To calculate EFV instead of EFM, activate this option. Flux bounds defined in the reactions and the current scenario are then taken into account as inhomogeneous constraints. A flux bound is only included when its absolute value is greater than the value given as “Threshold for bounds to be unconstrained”.

- check reversibility

Unchecking this option will lead to all reactions being considered reversible even if they have a rate minimum ≥ 0.

- only convex basis

Currently has no effect (need to be able to switch computation method first).

- consider isozymes only once

If a group of reactions has the same stoichiometry then only the modes with one representative of that group are calculated.

- use rational numbers

Use rational numbers of arbitrary length for EFM/EFV computation (efmtool part only, results will still appear as floating point numbers)

### Minimal cut sets

Minimal cut sets (MCS) can be calculated in CNApy using the dual method.

- Target and Desired region(s)

For the dual method one or more target regions must be defined which describe the network behaviour that is to be suppressed.
In addition, one or more desired regions may be defined which describe the network behaviour that is to be preserved.
Each target/desired region is defined by a set of linear equality constraints over the reaction rates in the network.
All target and desired regions must be initially feasible or an error will be raised. Also make sure that 0 is not included in any target or desired region (0 as target cannot be suppressed and 0 as desired is always fulfilled).

Note that all non-default reaction bounds (as defined by cobra.Configuration().bounds) are automatically added to all target and desired regions before MCS computation.

- Solver

MCS can either be calculated via CNA (using either Octave or Matlab) or via optlang using different MILP solvers.
For CNA the solver must be chosen while optlang uses the solver for the current model (cf. Solver for current model).
Not all variants and solvers allow for the same options so these will partly be disabled depending on the chosen solver.

- Max. solutions

Maximal number of MCS to calculate.

- Max. size

Only calculate MCS which consists of up to this number of cuts.

- Time limit

Do not run the search for longer than this limit.
It is strongly recommended to use this parameter because MCS computation can take very long especially when searching for smallest MCS.

- MCS search

MCS can be enumerated iteratively, either the smallest first (least number of cuts) or any MCS (up to the number of cuts given by max. size).
With the latter option new MCS are found more quickly but may not be the smallest.

With CPLEX or Gurobi as solver, MCS can also be enumerated by cardinality, i.e. all MCS of successively increasing size (up to max. size) are computed. In addition, with these solvers a continuous search mode is possible which is similar to the any MCS method but often faster.

- Gene KOs (CNA only)

If the model contains the gene-reaction association, search for gene knock-outs instead of reaction knock-outs.

- Exclude boundary reactions as cuts (optlang only)

Do not allow knock-out of boundary reactions (reactions that cross the system boundary, e.g. exchange reactions).

- Consider constraints given by scenario

Take reaction bounds set by the current scenario into account for all target and desired regions.
