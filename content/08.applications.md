## Analysis functions

### Flux balance analysis (FBA)

Optimizes the value of the current objective function and shows a flux distribution that realizes this optimum.
The objective function is a linear function over the reaction rates in the network, its coefficients can be modified in the reaction dialogs.
To display the current objective function you can choose *Show optimization function* from the *Analysis* menu.
The current objective value is shown in the console as well as the status bar at the bottom of the main window.
Note that the flux distribution calculated by FBA is usually not unique.

### Auto FBA

This is a checkable option which switches the "Auto FBA" mode on or off. In "Auto FBA" mode a FBA is automatically performed when a scenario is changed or when a reaction property that potentially influences the FBA result is changed.

### Parsimonious FBA (pFBA)

In parsimonious FBA first the objective function optimized and then with this optimum as additional constraint the sum of the fluxes in the network is minimized.
This has the advantage that redundant internal cyclic fluxes are suppressed and that a lot of reactions will have zero flux which makes the solution easier to understand.

### Flux variability analysis (FVA)

In FVA the maximal/minimal rate of each reaction is calculated.
This gives the possible flux range for each reaction.

### Make scenario feasible

A scenario is infeasible if the given fluxes in this scenario are incompatible with each other. An example would be a flux of a product that is higher than the substrate flux multiplied by the maximal product yield. Such a situation could for instance arise due to measurement errors if the given fluxes come from experimental measurements. 

With "Make scenario feasible" the given fluxes in the scenario are modified to be consistent which basically relies on minimzing the sum of absolute differences between the given values and the computed values that make the scenario consistent. There are two main settings that control this minimization: Firstly, one can choose whether the differences are linear or quadratic terms, resulting in a linear program (LP) or quadratic program (QP) respectively (the latter requires a QP-capable solver like CPLEX or Gurobi). Secondly, the (reciprocal) weights with which the differences enter the objective function can either all be equal, relative to their absolute flux values (i.e. larger fluxes are more likely to be changed when resolving infeasibilities), or taken from a specified field in the reaction annotation (in the last case, where a reaction has no entry in the specified annotation field, the default weight is used). Note that only reactions with scenario fluxes fixed to values unequal to zero enter the optimization.

After optimization, the current scenario is modified so that it contains the calculated consistent fluxes and the necessary changes are shown on the console. You can go back to the original values via the scenario history.

Known issue: The solvers are currently accessed through the optlang interface. Setting up the quadratic ojective for the QP via this interface incurs a significant overhead which increases with the number of fluxes set in the scenario. This means that the method as a whole can become quite slow in case more than a few dozen fluxes were set despite the fact that solving the QP itself is ususally quite fast.

### Elementary modes (EFM)

EFM can be calculated via [efmtool](https://csb.ethz.ch/tools/software/efmtool.html) which is automatically installed with CNApy. After calculation a [navigation panel](#efmmcs-navigation-and-analysis) appears to acces the results.

#### Options

When reactions are marked with 0 flux in a scenario and the option “consider 0 in current scenario as off” is activated then only the subset of EFM/EFV is calculated in which these reactions do not participate

### Computational strain design

#### Minimal cut sets

Minimal cut sets (MCS) can be calculated in CNApy using the dual method. After calculation a [navigation panel](#emfmcs-navigation-and-analysis) appears to acces the results.

- Target and Desired region(s)

For the dual method one or more target regions must be defined which describe the network behaviour that is to be suppressed.
In addition, one or more desired regions may be defined which describe the network behaviour that is to be preserved.
Each target/desired region is defined by a set of linear equality constraints over the reaction rates in the network.
All target and desired regions must be initially feasible or an error will be raised. Also make sure that 0 is not included in any target or desired region (0 as target cannot be suppressed and 0 as desired is always fulfilled).

Note that all non-default reaction bounds (as defined by cobra.Configuration().bounds) are automatically added to all target and desired regions before MCS computation.

- Current solver

MCS can be calculated via optlang using the currently active MILP solver.
Not all variants and solvers allow for the same options so these will partly be disabled depending on the chosen solver.

- Max. solutions

Maximal number of MCS to calculate.

- Max. size

Only calculate MCS which consists of up to this number of cuts.

- Time limit

Do not run the search for longer than this limit.
It is strongly recommended to use this parameter because MCS computation can take very long especially when searching for smallest MCS.

- MCS search

MCS can be enumerated iteratively, either the smallest first (least number of cuts) or any MCS (up to the number of cuts given by max. size).
With the latter option new MCS are found more quickly but may not be the smallest.

With CPLEX or Gurobi as solver, MCS can also be enumerated by cardinality, i.e. all MCS of successively increasing size (up to max. size) are computed.
In addition, with these solvers a continuous search mode is possible which is similar to the any MCS method but usually much faster.

- Exclude boundary reactions as cuts

Do not allow knock-out of boundary reactions (reactions that cross the system boundary, e.g. exchange reactions).

- Consider constraints given by scenario

Take reaction bounds set by the current scenario into account for all target and desired regions.

#### Compute strain designs

Opens a dialog which serves as front-end of the [StrainDesign](https://github.com/klamt-lab/straindesign) package for MILP-based strain design computation which supports MCS, MCS with nested optimization, OptKnock, RobustKnock and OptCouple, GPR-rule integration, gene and reaction knockouts and additions as well as regulatory interventions. A detailed description can be found in its [documentation](https://straindesign.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### EFM/MCS Navigation and analysis

After the computation of EFM or MCS a navigation panel appears below the map. With this you can browse through the results, select a subset of the modes/MCS and show some statistics. There is also a button for saving the results and one to clear them and close the navigation panel.

![
**Mode/MCS Navigation Panel.**
](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cnapy-org/CNApy-guide/main/content/images/mode-navigator.png "Mode/MCS Navigation Panel"){#fig:navigator}

- Select...

In this text field you can enter a comma-separated list of reaction IDs. After pressing "Enter" on the keyboard the subset of modes/MCS is shown in which all specified reactions occur. If you prepend a reaction ID with an exclamation mark (e.g. !R1) this means that the specified reaction must not participate in selected the modes/MCS. To revert the selection click on the clear button embedded in the text field.

- Reaction participation

Calculate the relative participation of each reaction in the currently selected modes/MCS. The results are shown in the reaction boxes and the "Flux" column of the reaction list.

- Size histogram

Calculate the pathway lengths/number of reactions of the currently selected modes/MCS. The result is shown as a size historam in the integrated Jupyter console.

### Yield optimization

![
**Yield optimization dialog.**
](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cnapy-org/CNApy-guide/main/content/images/yield-optimization-dialog.png "Yield optimization dialog"){#fig:yield-dialog}

Maximizes the value of a yield function *c/d* where *c* and *d* are linear expressions over the fluxes in the network.
For this to work correctly, there must be no flux vector in the network where the denominator becomes zero and the nominator is non-zero.
The flux values of the current scenario are taken into during the optimization.

A typical application would be the maximization of a product yield: When the exchange fluxes for ethanol and glucose are *EX_etoh* and *EX_glc* then maximizing *EX_etoh/-EX_glc gives* the maximal ethanol yield on glucose.

### Phase plane plot

![
**Phase plane plot dialog.**
](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cnapy-org/CNApy-guide/main/content/images/phase-plane-dialog.png "Phase plane plot dialog"){#fig:phase-plane-dialog}

Creates a plot (in the console) that shows the projection of the solution space onto a two-dimensional plane of two selected reaction rates.
The flux values of the current scenario are taken into account during the calculations.

### Compute in/out fluxes at a metabolite

If a flux distribution has been calculated (e.g. by FBA) this function shows the magnitude of all fluxes going in/coming out of a specified metabolite.
The reaction fluxes are displayed as stacked bar graphs on the console.
You can either call this function from the Analysis menu and specify a metabolite or right-click on a metabolite in the list and call the function from the context menu.

### Clipboard calculator

![
**Clipboard calculator.**
](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cnapy-org/CNApy-guide/main/content/images/clipboard-calculator.png "Clipboard calculator"){#fig:clipboard-calc}

The clipboard calculator allows you to perform arithmetic operations with the values stored in the clipboard, the current reaction rates or a fixed value that you can enter in this dialog.
The result of the operation replaces the current flux values.
