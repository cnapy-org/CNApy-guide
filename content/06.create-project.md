## Create a new project

In this section we explain how to create a new metabolic network project.
We also have a video on that topic [https://youtu.be/bsNXZBmtyWw](https://youtu.be/bsNXZBmtyWw).

CNApy starts with an empty project.
You can directly add new reactions via the reaction mask on the right.
by pressing the *Add new reaction* button.

Then, you can type the reaction formula into the Equation field. For example `A + 2 B -> C`.

The associated metabolites `A`, `B` and `C` are then automatically added to the model.

Changing metabolite identifiers in the metabolite form instantly rewrites the reaction equation of the associated reactions.

Since creating big models by adding single reactions is very cumbersome, CNApy also allows you to create a new project from a pre-existing SBML file.
You find the action *New project from SBML* in the *Project* menu.

After importing an SBML model, the reaction list is populated with all the reactions from the model.

You can add a map to the project by going to the *Map* menu and clicking *add new map*.

From the *Map* menu we can also *change the background image* of our map.
Any SVG image can be used as a background.

You can add multiple maps that highlight different aspects of your model.

Reaction boxes can be put on the map by dragging over them from the reactions list.

You can adjust the box size with the keyboard shortcuts `Ctrl`{.grey} + `+`{.grey} and `Ctrl`{.grey} + `-`{.grey}.
You can move the reaction box to the desired position by dragging them on their handles.
If you want to move all reaction boxes together, press `Ctrl`{.grey} while dragging.
In addition, you can set a specific (pixel-wise) position by right-clicking on a reaction box and selecting "set box position...".

Positioning a big number of reaction boxes can be tiresome.
Therefore, CNApy allows you to load and save reaction box positions via the *Map* menu.
This facilitates reuse among similar projects.

The size of the background image can be adjusted with the shortcuts `Ctrl`{.grey} + `Shift`{.grey} + `+`{.grey} and `Ctrl`{.grey} + `Shift`{.grey} + `-`{.grey}.

To save a project click *Save Project as* in the *Project* menu.
It is important to add the `.cna` extension to the file name.
This way your files can be directly found by CNApy. .cna files both include the metabolic model as well as its associated maps.
