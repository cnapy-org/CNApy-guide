## Introduction

This is the user manual of CNApy. CNApy is a graphical interface for the modelling and analysis of metabolic networks on the basis of constraint-based (stoichiometric) modeling approaches. Its main features are:

- Import/export of metabolic models in the widely used SBML format
- Visualizing the reactions and solutions in the form of CNApy (with text boxes and an SVG background) or [Escher maps](https://escher.github.io/) (which are fully editable)
- Convenient exploration and editing of the model, including its reactions, metabolites and genes
- Creation, loading and saving of CNApy scenarios which add custom linear constraints, reactions and flux bounds to the model without directly altering the model itself
- Model analysis with standard and advanced constraint-based methods (listed below)
- Saving everything as a CNApy *.cna project

The methods provided for model analysis (some of them are part of CNApy and some provided by [COBRApy](https://opencobra.github.io/cobrapy/)) include:

- Flux Balance Analysis (FBA)
- Flux Variability Analysis (FVA)
- Making measured flux scenarios stoichiometrically feasible
- Elementary Flux Modes (EFM)
- Thermodynamic methods based on [OptMDFpathway](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006492)
- Many advanced strain design algorithms such as [OptKnock](https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.10803), [RobustKnock](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btp704), [OptCouple](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mec.2019.e00087) and [advanced Minimal Cut Sets](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008110) through its integration of the [StrainDesign](https://github.com/klamt-lab/straindesign) package.
- Yield optimization (based on linear-fractional programming)
- Phase plane analysis

All results of these calculations can then be visualized in the model's map as well as exported in the form of text or partly Excel XLSX files.
