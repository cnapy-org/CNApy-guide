# Introduction

This is the user manual of CNApy. CNApy is a graphical interface for the modelling and analysis of metabolic networks on the basis of constraint-based (stoichiometric) modeling approaches. It allows

- the import/export of SBML models
- creating COBRApy/CNA models
- linking a graphical representation to the model data
- convenient exploration and  editing of the model
- model analysis with standard and advanced constraint-based methods
- and saving everything as a CNApy *.cna project

The methods provided for model analysis (some of them are part of CNApy but most are functions from CNA and COBRApy) include:

- Flux balance analysis
- Parsimonious flux balance analysis
- Flux variability analysis
- Minimal cut sets
- Elementary modes
- Phase plane analysis
- Yield optimization
